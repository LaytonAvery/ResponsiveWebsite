# ResponsiveWebsite
The goal of this project was to attempt to make my first responsive website without bootstrap.
I learned Flexbox and utilized various div and ID elements in HTML as well as a media query in CSS to ensure the page is responsive.
Moving forward, I plan on adding links to each menu item that provide more information about each flower listed.
